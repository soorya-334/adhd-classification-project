# ADHD Classification Using Multimodal MRI and Clinical Features

This project implements and novel supervised machine learning models to classify ADHD versus non-ADHD children using multimodal MRI features and clinical covariates. It includes a novel Attention-Weighted SVM (AttSVM) model alongside GLMnet, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

## üß† Project Highlights

- High-accuracy ADHD classification using structural MRI and clinical features
- Comparison of 4 models: GLMnet, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AttSVM
- Feature fusion strategy via attention-based weighting
- Achieved 96.8% test accuracy and AUC of 0.99 using GLMnet
