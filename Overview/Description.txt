# ADHD Classification Using Multimodal MRI and Clinical Features

This project implements and novel supervised machine learning models to classify ADHD versus non-ADHD children using multimodal MRI features and clinical covariates. It includes a novel Attention-Weighted SVM (AttSVM) model alongside GLMnet, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

## üß† Project Highlights

- High-accuracy ADHD classification using structural MRI and clinical features
- Comparison of 4 models: GLMnet, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AttSVM
- Feature fusion strategy via attention-based weighting
- Achieved 96.8% test accuracy and AUC of 0.99 using GLMnet

## üîß Machine learning Algorithm

 - The dataset was preprocessed by merging clinical and MRI-derived imaging features, followed by cleaning, normalization, and handling of missing values.
 - Feature engineering included extracting over 5,000 texture and volumetric features from 26 brain regions and encoding clinical variables like race, sex, and medication history.
 - Data was split into training and testing sets (60:40 ratio) using stratified sampling to preserve class balance.
 - Four machine learning models were trained: GLMnet (elastic-net logistic regression), Random Forest, XGBoost, and an Attention-Weighted SVM (AttnSVM).
 - The AttnSVM model fused two SVMs (imaging and clinical) by weighting their prediction probabilities based on AUC, enhancing decision balance across modalities.
 - All models were evaluated on independent test data using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.
 - Visualization outputs included ROC curves, confusion matrices, calibration plots, and bar charts, with feature importance extracted for model interpretability.
